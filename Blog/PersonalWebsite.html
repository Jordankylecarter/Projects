      <p>
        My Name is Jordan Carter. I am 22 years old, graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science in May 2020, and work as an IT Support Specialist for an AT&T Authorized Retailer company. <br>
        I am attempting to learn web development and my project right now is to make a blog. I think I want the blog to just be about my journey to learning software development and for documenting <br>
        what I've learned and my general outlook on software development as a whole. Maybe the content of the blog will change over time as I learn more.
